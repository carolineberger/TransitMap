# TransitMap

Transit Technical Interview Test 

Here is a simple test to understand how you organise your code and what you consider best
practices. You donâ€™t have any restriction to realise this sample app. We would like an estimate
of the time it took you to accomplish this test. We are aware that a big part of time spent on this
test would be to setup your project.

The app you should build is a map that represent all the region Transit supports. This app needs
to show all supported region on a map. Regions should be represented by a pin and upon
clicking that pin, there should be a popup that shows up to with the feed name and the city.

The pins should be using a custom image provided with this document. Pins in each country
should have a different color:
- Canada: #f44336
- United-State: #e040fb
- France: #3f51b5
- United Kingdom: #8bc34a
- Germany: #ffc107
- Other country: #00bcd4

To get the list of supported feeds, you can use this JSON API (note that this API updates daily):
